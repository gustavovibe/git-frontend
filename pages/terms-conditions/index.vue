  <div class="main-spacing mb-8">
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      These Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as "Terms" or "Conditions") govern all bookings made with Vibe Adventures, Inc. (referred to as "Vibe Adventures," "we," "us," or "our"). The terms "Client," "Customer," "Traveler," "you," and "your" refer collectively to all individuals included in the booking, including any persons added or replaced at a later date.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      The booking conditions outlined herein, together with any additional written information provided to you prior to the confirmation of your booking and the terms set forth by our suppliers, constitute the foundation of your contractual agreement with us regarding the travel arrangements detailed on <a class="text-orange-vibe" href="http://www.vibeadventures.com">vibeadventures.com</a> (except for operator.vibeadventures.com which is managed by its own <a class="text-orange-vibe" href="https://vibeadventures.com/booking-terms-conditions/">terms</a>) and making up your booking ("your arrangements"). It is imperative that you review the aforementioned documents thoroughly, as they delineate our respective rights and obligations. By making a booking, you, on behalf of yourself and any individuals you represent, agree to be bound by all terms and conditions contained therein. In the event that you are making a booking on behalf of another individual, you hereby agree to notify that person of the Terms and Conditions applicable to the travel reservations and bookings you have secured on their behalf, encompassing all relevant rules and restrictions. Please note that these Terms and Conditions include provisions related to waivers of liability, waivers of class action rights, as well as clauses regarding venue selection and notice requirements.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      At the time of booking, you must be of legal age and possess the necessary legal capacity and authority to act as the lead name for the booking and to undertake travel. All communications and correspondence will be conducted exclusively with the individual designated as the lead name on the booking.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Important Notice: We make every effort to guarantee the accuracy of all information and pricing provided on our website and in our promotional materials. However, occasional updates and errors may occur, and we retain the right to correct such inaccuracies. It is your responsibility to verify the current pricing and all relevant details pertaining to the arrangements you intend to book prior to the confirmation of your booking.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      In these terms, the term "package" refers to a pre-arranged combination of a minimum of two of the following components when offered for sale at an inclusive price, and when the service encompasses a duration exceeding twenty-four hours or includes overnight accommodation: (a) transportation; (b) accommodation; (c) additional tourist services that are not supplementary to transportation or accommodation and constitute a significant portion of the package.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">1. Our agreement</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      To secure your holiday booking, it is mandatory to follow the online booking process. In certain instances, if you contact our Customer Service team, we may facilitate this process on your behalf. By submitting (or consenting for us to submit on your behalf) your booking through our website, you acknowledge and accept these terms on behalf of all individuals listed in the booking. A binding agreement regarding your arrangements will be formed between you and us upon the issuance of a confirmation.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      It is essential to verify all booking details, including personal information, before finalizing your booking for confirmation. Should you book through our Customer Service team, please ensure that you provide accurate information and review the confirmation (or any other documents issued) immediately upon receipt. Please be aware that making changes to your arrangements post-confirmation may not be feasible; therefore, you should carefully review all information before completing your purchase. In the event that you require modifications at a later date, the provisions outlined in the "<a class="text-orange-vibe" href="#Changes">Changes</a>" section of these Terms and Conditions will apply. You can access your booking details in your "My Account."
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      The suppliers providing the services associated with your arrangements operate under their own terms and conditions, which will also constitute part of your agreement with us. These terms may limit or exclude the supplier's liability to you, often in accordance with applicable International Conventions. While we exercise due diligence in selecting our suppliers, we disclaim any liability for insolvency or bankruptcy.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Travel is a personal endeavor, and individual goals and experiences may vary. We will not be held liable for any descriptions, photographs, representations, or warranties made by or provided by independent third-party sales representatives, travel agents, or other entities concerning any holiday or vacation offered by us.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">2. Payment</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Full payment is required at the time of booking to secure your reservation. In cases where installment payment options are selected, the entire outstanding balance must be received as per the payment schedule outlined during the booking process.. Should we fail to receive any payment in full and by the specified due date, we reserve the right to consider your booking as canceled by you, in which case the cancellation fees outlined in the "<a class="text-orange-vibe" href="#Cancellations">Cancellations</a>" section will be applicable.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      By selecting credit card as your payment method, you acknowledge and agree to adhere to the cancellation policies set forth in these Terms and Conditions in the event of a cancellation,, and your right to initiate a chargeback will be waived, except in instances of fraud. Furthermore, should you request a chargeback that necessitates our dispute, you will be responsible for all associated costs incurred by us, including attorney's fees.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">3. Insurance</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      We strongly recommend that all individuals listed on the booking purchase comprehensive travel insurance. Please refer to the booking terms provided by the adventure operator for detailed information on coverage limits and requirements necessary for participating in the adventure.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Certain countries mandate that foreign visitors have valid medical insurance upon entry. We shall not be held liable for denied entry if you are unable to provide proof of insurance or for any other reason.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Please be aware that insurance companies typically impose deadlines between booking and/or departure dates and policy issuance. Therefore, we advise purchasing insurance immediately upon receiving your booking confirmation from us.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Choosing not to obtain adequate travel protection may result in the loss of travel expenses and/or require additional funds to resolve any issues.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      You acknowledge that without this coverage, there may be no recourse to recover any incurred losses, expenses, or costs.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">4. Special Requests</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Any special requests pertaining to your arrangements should be communicated to us at the time of booking and confirmed in writing. Although we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate these requests, we cannot assure their fulfillment. Special requests documented in your confirmation or other related materials do not constitute a guarantee of compliance. The inability to fulfill any special request shall not be considered a breach of contract by us unless the request has been explicitly confirmed.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      If you or any member of your group has a medical condition or disability that may impact your selected arrangements, please furnish us with complete details prior to the confirmation of your booking. This information will allow us to assess the suitability of the arrangements for your needs. In our reasonable judgment, if we are unable to adequately accommodate your requirements, we will not proceed with confirming your booking. Furthermore, if you do not provide us with comprehensive details at the time of booking, we will regard the reservation as canceled by you once we become aware of such information.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">5. Price</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      The cost of the arrangements you select is determined based on the services and dates you choose, and it will vary depending on the number of individuals included in the booking. You are responsible for reviewing the sections entitled "what the price includes" and "what the price does not include" prior to finalizing your booking.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      In certain jurisdictions, hotels or other travel service providers may impose local fees or tourist taxes that require direct payment. We encourage you to contact us for further information regarding these charges.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Please be advised that we reserve the right to adjust the prices of unsold holiday arrangements and to rectify any errors found in the pricing of confirmed holidays.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Cancellations" class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">6. Cancellations</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Partial cancellations of a booking are not permitted. If the customer(s) want to cancel the booking, the cancellation policy in this section will apply. In this sense, we incur several non-refundable costs before the cancellation is made, and therefore, the penalties are proportional to these costs. In case of cancellation, Vibe Adventures is entitled to claim the applicable penalty for the expenses/costs incurred.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-green-vibe text-xl font-semibold canaro-font">6.1. Cancellation by the Customer</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Cancellations will only be accepted in writing once a partial or full payment has been made. If you wish to cancel your reservation, please submit your request via our contact form on our website.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Your cancellation request will become effective upon receipt in writing. If the request is received outside of our Customer Service operating hours, it will be processed on the next business day (please verify our operating hours in the "Contact" section of our website).
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      The specific cancellation conditions applicable to each trip are outlined in the "Conditions" section of the offer. In the absence of specific conditions, the following cancellation fees will apply.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      You may cancel your trip at any time prior to departure and may be eligible for a partial refund. Cancellation fees will be determined by the policies of the service providers included in your package, specifically the tour operator responsible for the multi-day adventure and the flight carriers involved (you can review their cancellation terms in the "My Account" section of our website).
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Without prejudice to your right to purchase coverage as detailed in subsequent clauses, any penalties and administrative fees will be deducted from any payments received by Vibe Adventures, Inc. If your cancellation falls under the terms and conditions of your insurance policy, you may seek reimbursement for these costs from the insurance provider.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-green-vibe text-xl font-semibold canaro-font">6.2. Cancellation by Vibe Adventures</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">We keep the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alter the date of departure or the end of the trip;</li>
      <li>Change any non-essential aspects of the trip;</li>
      <li>Cancel or modify the trip, including any routes or objectives specified in the itinerary;</li>
      <li>Cancel the trip if the required minimum number of registered participants is not achieved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Should any changes, modifications, cancellations, postponements, or delays occur as described herein, you accept that you will not be entitled to a refund of the trip price, in whole or in part, nor will you have the right to seek compensation for any injury, loss, damage, or additional costs incurred due to such changes, modifications, cancellations, postponements, or delays.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify underline">Endemic and Pandemic Situations</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      If the country you're traveling to requires a health test or any specific requirement, you are responsible for covering any associated costs. It's also your responsibility to ensure that you take the test within the required timeframe set by your destination. Should you experience symptoms related to endemic or pandemic diseases during your trip that necessitate changes to your contracted services (e.g., hotel or flight modifications), any additional costs incurred will be your responsibility. You will need to claim these expenses from your insurer afterward.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify underline">Other Cancellations</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Except where explicitly stated otherwise in these booking conditions, we shall not be held liable or obligated to provide compensation for any impact on our contractual obligations to you resulting from Force Majeure. Force Majeure refers to any unforeseen event that we or the supplier(s) of the services involved could not have reasonably anticipated or prevented. Such events may include, but are not limited to, war, the threat of war, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and their consequences, riots, actions taken by any governmental or local authority, including port or river authorities, labor disputes, lock closures, natural or nuclear disasters, fires, chemical or biological incidents, adverse weather conditions, maritime conditions, ice, and river conditions, as well as any other occurrences beyond our or the supplier(s) control.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      A pandemic, such as COVID-19, is regarded as a force majeure event. However, given the unprecedented effects of COVID-19 on the travel sector, Vibe Adventures has established particular conditions to support the recovery of operations. These terms have been outlined in detail in the prior section.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      For group trips, Vibe Adventures plans arrangements at the destination based on an anticipated number of participants. If the required minimum number of travelers is not met, we retain the discretion to cancel the booking and treat it as a "major change," subject to the terms specified in the section titled "Changes" below.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Changes" class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">7. Changes</h2>
    <h3 class="text-green-vibe text-xl font-semibold canaro-font">7.1. Changes by the Customer</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Should you wish to make any modifications to your arrangements after confirmation, you are required to notify us in writing at the earliest opportunity by submitting a request through the “Contact Us” form available on this website.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Your request for a change will only be effective upon receipt in writing, and if received outside our Customer Service operating hours, it will take effect from the next working day (please refer to our Customer Service operating hours in the “Contact” section of this website). If we are unable to accommodate your requested change and you choose not to proceed with the original booking, we will consider this as a cancellation by you, and the conditions outlined in the Cancellation Policy will apply based on the proximity to the departure date.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      While we will make every effort to fulfill your requested changes, we cannot guarantee their feasibility. In the event that we are able to accommodate your request, you will be responsible for any applicable rate adjustments or additional costs incurred by Vibe Adventures, as well as any costs or charges imposed by our suppliers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Certain arrangements, particularly those related to flights, may be non-amendable after confirmation, and any modifications or cancellations may result in a charge of up to 100% of the affected portion of the arrangements, in addition to the aforementioned charges.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-green-vibe text-xl font-semibold canaro-font">7.2. Changes by Vibe Adventures</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      As we plan your arrangements well in advance, there may be circumstances where we need to make changes to or cancel them. Most changes will be minor, and while we will endeavor to notify you of them as soon as reasonably possible before your departure, we will not be liable to you for any other consequences.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Examples of “minor changes” made before departure include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A change in the overall duration of your arrangements by twelve hours or less.</li>
      <li>A change of accommodation to another of similar standard or classification.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      At times, it may become necessary for us to implement substantial modifications to your confirmed arrangements. Examples of such "major changes" made prior to departure may include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A change in the accommodation location for the entirety or a substantial part of your trip.</li>
      <li>A downgrade in the standard or classification of accommodation for the entirety or a substantial part of your trip.</li>
      <li>A change in the overall duration of your arrangements by twelve hours or more.</li>
      <li>Significant alterations to your itinerary include omitting one or more destinations entirely.</li>
      <li>The complete cancellation of the trip due to failure to meet the minimum group quota (applicable only to group travel).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      If we need to make a major change or cancel your arrangements, we will inform you as soon as possible. If there is sufficient time before departure, we will offer you the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accepting the revised arrangements.</li>
      <li>Receiving a full refund of all amounts paid in the form of a Travel Credit.</li>
      <li>Accepting an alternative offer of comparable standard arrangements from us, if available. (If the alternative is of lower value, we will refund the price difference in the form of a Travel Credit; conversely, if the alternative is of higher value, you will incur additional costs.)</li>
      <li>You must inform us of your choice within 3 days of receiving our offer. Failure to do so will be deemed as acceptance of the proposed change or alternative arrangements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      We will not offer compensation, and the above options will not be available if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The change is minor.</li>
      <li>We cancel due to your failure to make payment in accordance with these terms.</li>
      <li>The change or cancellation by us is a result of alterations to the confirmed booking requested by you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      If we cannot provide a significant portion of your arrangements after your departure, we will make alternative arrangements. Suppose this is impossible, or you choose not to accept them for valid reasons. In that case, we will provide you with equivalent transportation back to your point of departure or another mutually agreed-upon location. If your arrangements constitute a package and are appropriate, we will also provide reasonable compensation. However, we regret that we cannot offer refunds, compensation, or coverage of costs or expenses resulting from changes or cancellations caused by "force majeure" events (please refer to the forthcoming section for more details).
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">8. Complaints</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      If you encounter any issues during your trip, please notify the relevant supplier immediately so they can rectify the situation. You can also contact us using the “Contact Us” form on our website or through our contact phone line.
      <br>
      If your complaint remains unresolved and you seek further escalation, you please submit a formal written complaint to us within 14 days of the conclusion of your arrangements, providing your booking reference and all relevant details. Failure to follow this procedure may impact our ability, as well as that of the relevant supplier, to investigate your complaint and may affect your rights under our agreement.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">9. Your Conduct</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      If, in our reasonable opinion or that of any relevant authority, your conduct is found to cause or is likely to cause harm, danger, property damage, significant inconvenience, or disruption to others or transportation services, we reserve the right to terminate your booking arrangements immediately. In such circumstances, all contractual obligations on our part will end, and you will be required to vacate the accommodation or discontinue the service without entitlement to refunds, compensation, or reimbursement of any costs, expenses, or losses incurred.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Furthermore, you may be held responsible for any damage or loss caused directly by your actions and will be required to compensate the relevant supplier before leaving the service. Failure to resolve such matters may render you fully liable for any claims, damages, or costs levied against us resulting from your actions.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">10. Our responsibilities</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      We acknowledge our responsibility as a seller of holiday packages within applicable legislation. Under these booking conditions, if we or our suppliers negligently fail to perform or arrange the services as specified in your confirmation, we will provide reasonable compensation. However, it is your responsibility to demonstrate negligence on our part or that of our supplier(s) if you intend to make a claim against us.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      We disclaim all liability and shall not provide compensation for any injury, illness, death, loss, damage, expense, cost, or any other claim resulting from:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Actions or omissions of the affected individual(s);</li>
      <li>Actions or omissions of an unrelated third party involved in the provision of contracted services, which were unforeseeable or unavoidable;</li>
      <li>Unusual or unforeseeable circumstances beyond our or our supplier(s) control, the consequences of which could not have been avoided despite exercising due care; or</li>
      <li>An event that neither ourselves nor our suppliers could have foreseen or prevented, even with due care.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      However, in cases where your arrangements constitute a package, we may offer reasonable assistance if you encounter difficulties arising from these circumstances.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      We will not be liable or provide compensation for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Services or facilities not included in our agreement or not advertised by us, such as excursions booked independently or services provided by your hotel or other suppliers;</li>
      <li>Any damage, loss, expense, or other consequence that we could not have foreseen based on the information provided by you prior to confirming your arrangements, or that pertains to any business-related matters;</li>
      <li>Transportation of luggage and personal belongings is at your own risk and should be supervised at all times. For air, rail, sea, or river transport, the terms set by transportation companies will apply as stated in the relevant passenger ticket document. In case of damage, delay, or loss, you must report it immediately to the respective carrier.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Any compensation payable will be determined considering various factors, including (but not limited to):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether you have followed the complaints procedure outlined in these conditions. It is a precondition for our liability under this clause that you adhere to the specified complaints procedure when notifying us or our supplier(s) of any claim;</li>
      <li>The extent to which negligence on our or our employees’ or suppliers’ part impacted the overall enjoyment of your arrangements;</li>
      <li>When making a payment, we reserve the right to deduct any compensation received or due from any transport provider or hotelier for the same complaint or claim.</li>
      <li>It should be noted that where any payment is made, the recipient (and their guardian if under legal age) must assign to us or our insurers any rights they may have against any third party and provide us and our insurers with all necessary assistance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      We are responsible for providing the services and accommodations described in the brochure or website relevant to your booked trip, except in cases where it is not feasible or the itinerary is altered due to delays or other circumstances beyond our control. In such instances, we and our suppliers will strive to offer comparable alternatives, but no refund will be provided.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Vibe Adventures, its suppliers, partners, agents, and employees shall not be liable for cancellations, actions of other service providers, equipment substitutions, or any acts or changes made by air carriers, land carriers, hoteliers, transportation companies, or any other service providers, including any resulting consequences. We will not be liable for loss or damage to baggage or property, injury, illness, death, or any damages arising from the actions of any person not directly employed by us or under our exclusive control. The released parties shall bear no responsibility for any indirect, special, or consequential damages. Participants assume full responsibility for their baggage and personal belongings, which remain at their own risk at all times.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Independent operators, carriers, hotels, and other suppliers providing services on the holiday are not agents, employees, or servants of Vibe Adventures or its associated companies. Travel documents issued by Vibe Adventures are subject to the terms and conditions specified by the carriers, suppliers, and the laws of the countries where the services are provided. Carriage by sea is subject to the individual carrier’s conditions of carriage, which you can see during the booking. The released parties are not responsible for criminal or other conduct by third parties, whether intentional or negligent.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      Additional risks may result from a variety of factors, such as traveling in remote or undeveloped regions, transportation-related hazards, natural disasters, political instability, cultural practices, inadequate sanitation, differing safety standards, and potential interactions with animals, among other circumstances. By choosing to participate voluntarily in these activities, you acknowledge and accept all inherent risks and liabilities associated with them. By agreeing to participate in the trip, you waive the right to make any claim against Vibe Adventures, its related companies, or its personnel for any bodily injury, emotional trauma, property damage, or other loss arising from the trip. This release of liability agreement applies to you and all members of your party, including minors, and binds your heirs, legal representatives, and assigns.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">11. Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      The Booking Conditions and any associated agreements are governed exclusively by the law of Delaware, United States. We mutually agree that any disputes, claims, or matters arising between us regarding your contract or booking will be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction within the State of Delaware.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      By paying for a trip, you acknowledge and accept these sales conditions. You expressly waive any right to seek punitive damages. We shall only be liable for compensatory damages.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      You understand and agree that no claims will be entertained, and you will refrain from taking legal action against us unless you have first provided written notice of claim to Vibe Adventures within 7 days of the trip or its cancellation. Claims against us must be brought solely in your individual capacity, not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-green-vibe text-2xl font-semibold canaro-font">12. Passport, Immigration and Health Formalities</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      You must verify and meet the passport, visa, health, and immigration requirements relevant to your itinerary. While we can offer general guidance on these matters, you must ascertain the requirements specific to your situation by consulting the appropriate Embassies and/or Consulates and your medical practitioner, as applicable. Regulations may change, necessitating that you verify the current status well before your departure. Many countries now mandate passports to remain valid for at least six months beyond the return date. Should your passport expire within the final year, it is advisable to confirm with your destination country's embassy.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      We bear no liability if you cannot travel or incur losses due to non-compliance with passport, visa, immigration requirements, or health formalities. You agree to indemnify us for any fines or losses incurred due to your failure to comply with these requirements.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-justify">
      PASSPORT AND VACCINATION NOTICE: For all trips, it is your responsibility to confirm and comply with mandatory entry requirements. These may include, but are not limited to, the need for a valid transit visa (as required by certain countries such as the United States, even if you do not exit the airport), passport validity requirements (some countries require a passport to remain valid for up to six months beyond your return date), and vaccination rules, including COVID-19 vaccination protocols and diagnostic testing. Such requirements must be verified with the relevant authorities of each destination and/or stopover country.Refer to the official websites of immigration and health agencies in your country and those of the destination and stopover countries, as well as airline requirements. Vibe Adventures bears no responsibility for denied entry or exit from destination countries or transit stops due to traveler-specific reasons, lack of required documentation, or failure to meet stated requirements, resulting in any incurred expenses, applying the non-appearance policy at departure.
